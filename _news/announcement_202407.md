I attended the [Ocean Uncertainty Quantification Summer School](https://usclivar.org/meetings/ocean-uncertainty-quantification-summer-school) held on the campus of the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science in Virginia Key, Miami, FL. This is not a topic that I'm super familiar with but I learned a lot in one week.
