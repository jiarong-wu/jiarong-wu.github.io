I participated in the Center for Turbulence Research (CTR) 2024 Summer Program. I was in the geophysical flow group with eight teams of turbulence researches from all over the world. I spent four weeks on futher analysis and uncertainty quantification of the two-phase high-fidelity wind-wave simulation I developed in my PhD thesis.
