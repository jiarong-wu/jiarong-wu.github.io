I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), New York University, working with [Prof. Laure Zanna](https://zanna-researchteam.github.io/), and as a member of Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics ([LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/)). I am looking for ways to improve air-sea flux parameterizations in climate models, using a combination of observational data, high-fidelity numerical simulations, and data-driven methods.  

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. at Princeton University, advised by [Prof. Luc Deike](https://ldeike.princeton.edu). My thesis focuses on the dynamics of ocean surface waves in the context of air-sea interaction. In general, my research interests include fluid dynamics, waves, turbulence, ocean physics, climate modeling, and computational methods.

I am original from Huzhou, China. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, making food, taking photos, and learning about music theory. My name is pronounced as \`Jar-Wrong\`.
